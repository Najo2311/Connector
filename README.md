# Connector
In this case I prefer YOLOv5 model for classifying connector.
It will help to display the result that connector OK or Not.
First I collect the Dataset and then annote that dataset, After that Train the dataset with 100 epochs
and It gives 97% accuracy
This model will correctly identifies the connector and displays the output at the speed of : 0.6ms
